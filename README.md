#Description
  As part of coding challenge from Uber, this web app uses 511 Real Time Transit service tpo fetch departure times for public transport stops.

##Focus
  This solution focusses more on backend, with a very minimal UI.

##Technical choices
  * This is my first attempt with Backbone.JS and Node.JS. My skillset is more on backend-track. Not surprisingly I struggled a lot with Backbone.JS.
  * Architecturally, I didn't feel the need to introduce a DB for the backend. The state of various agencies and route information can be collected on application startup and kept in memory.
